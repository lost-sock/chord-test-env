# [0] I’d highly reccomend checking out salomon’s quest 4d gtx boots. I and many other people on here seem to like them a lot, but of course you should always try on boots before you decide to buy them. Not everyone’s feet are the same so be sure to try a lot of different boots on until you find a pair that really fits you well and is comfortable.

# ========

# [1] Hey I just bought new boots to replace my 15 year old Vasques and I used to sell boots so I’m qualified to answer this question!

# First off, like others have said - go try a bunch of pairs on and see what suits you. There’s no perfect boot, just dif models that fit different foot types and preferences. That said, here are a few recs from current models:

# -Asolo Falcon GV (what I settled on). Bit pricey but I think they’re worth it. Light for how supportive they are and I actually like the European styling

# -Lowa Renegade - classic boot that a lot of people like. Known for being comfy but not super durable. I think they sell a variety of widths. 

# -La Sportiva Nucleo - cut a bit high for my taste but otherwise nice boots

# -Vasque Breeze - kind of a more budget option. I used to swear by Vasque and this is perennial best seller

# -Merrell Moab Ventilator

# -Salomon Quest 4D

# Good luck!



# ========

# [2] I have a pair of Keens that I just love. They are one of the Targhee models. They never felt like they needed any breaking in- perfect for me from day one, have a nice wide toe box, and are pretty water resistant without making my feet too sweaty. I think you should try on a pair if you can.

# ========

# [3] I think you should go try on lots of pairs to see what feels the most comfortable. Here's what I think you should look for:

# -Lighter is better. More and more people use trail runners and lightweight hiking boots  because they aren't as tiring to hike in. If you don't hike much and do more bushcraft type stuff like chopping wood, then definitely stick to a slightly beefier boot.

# -Don't get waterproof boots. Your feet will just end up wet from sweat if you hike in warm weather. Good breathable boots will dry out very quickly if they do get wet from rain or puddles.

# -The best pair of trail footwear is the one that fits your foot the best and feels the most comfortable. Some brands are better than others so it's obviously important to do your research on quality and value but the most important part is that the boots feel comfortable on your feet.

# ========

# [4] REI’s anniversary sale is coming up mid-May and there should be a garage sale in May too if you’re in no rush and want to check out deals



# ========

# [5] Lowa’s Renegade are the best pair of hikers that I have owned lately. Close to your $250 mark, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised. Worth noting that they come in a wide version, which is something important to me. Good luck! 

# ========

# [6] big question! where are you hiking? Everyone here seems obsessed with waterproof not being essential. If you hike where I hike then that's the 101 - let us know...

# ========

# [7] Whatever you do make sure you try them on and work with a knowledgeable sales person. Be willing to pay the 10% brick and mortar markup but it is totally worth it. Having a suggested brand really doesn't help fit and feel really is the really decider. Walk around the shop in them, if they don't have an incline decline ramp the shop isn't worth its weight  usually because you need to stand and step on a decline to feel out the toe box. A good shop should not trust the customers idea of their own shoe size and always measure them because the customer is never right. Also wear your hiking socks to the Try on. They better be wool and they better be mirno wool.

# All that said I'm a big fan of saleawa shoes a boots. 

# ========

# [8] I hike in cold weather and often get up to the snow. Waterproof is important to me.

# ========

# [9] Solomon’s 

# ========

# [10] Have you tried trail runners? Switched a few years back and I'm not looking back. Started using trekking poles to help stabilize as well.

# ========

# [11] Had Keen, Solomon, Danner, and true best imo are Merrell.  Regardless make sure to get combo of vibram sole and goretex.  If hiking with weighted pack make sure boot made to take extra weight and abuse.

# ========

# [12] Danner Mountain 600 or Danner Jag. They're both waterproof yet breathable, lightweight, the former is more sneaker-oriented, the latter more mid-boot. Made in Vermont, guaranteed for life. Can't go wrong!

# ========

# [13] I wear timberland euro hikers I recommend them but I wear a 4.5 kids so good hiking boots are far and few in between 

# ========

# [14] The best boots I have bought were a pair of Vasques that I wore nearly every trip for 15 years. I probably paid $175 for them at REI in the late 1990's. Leather uppers and lowers that were supple and broke in great. I had them repaired a couple times, but I finally had to retire them. Broke my heart and I still can't bring myself to toss them out. 

# Bought another pair of Vasques and they just aren't the same. I've tried other brands, but I don't hike like I used to, so I don't require the same kind of boot.

# ========

# [15] Lowa Renegade GTX Mid Boot are outstanding boots.  Lightweight, sturdy and very comfortable. 

# ========

# [16] It depends what you are using them for. For most of my backpacking carrying a medium weight pack, I usually go with my Asolo. If I will be mountaineering and have the need to use crampons and carrying a heavier pack I would definitely use mountaineering boots, I like my Scarpa’s. 

# ========

# [17] I’ve been rocking variations of the Merrell MOAB Mid Goretex for years. I love it. 

# ========

# [18] I wear keens. Easily within your budget really comfy good weight I like the ankle support so I get boots as opposed to trail runners or a short boot but that's personal preference. 

# ========

# [19] Second the 4d gtx, great boots. 

# ========

# [20] I bought a pair of these last year and I can’t recommend them enough—they’re more comfortable than my sneakers.  There’s a ton of support for when i have to pack more than my fair share of gear for week-long trips and they work great as snow boots if you’re in colder climates.   I also have flat + wide feet and these have a ton of arch support and a toe box that’s plenty wide.

# ========

# [21] They were too narrow for me and smashed my pinkie toe even when I sized up.  I know someone said they have wide feet and these fit fine, but that was not my experience.  I’m experimenting with wider trail runners like Altra and they seem good so far.

# With shoes you always need to try them on first or be prepared to return them

# ========

# [22] I have been using salomon discovery gtx boots for years and I love them. They are a great lighter weight and lower cost option than the quest 4d

# ========

# [23] Salomon Quest 4D GTX are my favorites as well.

# I found them on sale for $150 CAD, if you shop around online you can probably find a similar deal. It's important to try them on in-store first, of course so you may want to go bricks and mortar on your first pair.


# ========

# [24] Vasque moved their production to China since you bought your last pair so you may be disappointing in comparison to what you had.  Still a great boot, just not as good. 

# ========

# [25] Would second any of the above named!! They are all my favorites too - each of those has a slightly different fit so one of them should feel comfortable for your feet. The quality is there in all of them.

# One thing to consider are Garmonts but they are not in REI...

# PS: I am a gear junkie and data analyst hence I love comparing and researching gear. 

# ========

# [26] I also have these and love them. The toe box reeled me in and they have not dissapointed!

# ========

# [27] I have an old pair of Targhees (women's) from 2008ish and they've held up fantastically. I don't have plans to replace them any time soon. Highly recommend!

# ========

# [28] Yes I love my keens 

# ========

# [29] Lighter is not always better, waterproof is very useful in many environments, but you are right about the fit. 

# Be careful to not generalize based on your experiences.  There are several questions and things that need to be asked before you can come close to the conclusions you've made. 

# ========

# [30] I don’t think breathable and waterproof are mutually exclusive.  You can get good waterproof, breathable boots.  If you’re only getting one pair of all around boots I think what you want to avoid are insulated boots.  Those will be great in cold weather but will be awful and swampy in hot weather.  So get non-insulated boots but then get some insulated (Marino wool etc)  and non-insulated socks, then choose which socks you’ll wear depending on weather.   I have some waterproof Oboz that are tremendous and were right around $200 I think.

# ========

# [31] Got them myself and have been non stop wearing them. It’s not even hiking season for us yet and yet every time I go on a walk they are all I want to wear! Amazing boots. Super comfy. Grips on ice well! I can’t stop myself from jumping in puddles to “test out the gore tex technology”

# ========

# [32] > Good breathable boots will dry out very quickly if they do get wet from rain or puddles.

# That's if they're left in the sun or if you are moving enough to walk them dry. For a more sedate pace, waterproof is a must when it's wet out.

# I otherwise agree. For constant walking, nonwaterproof trail runners are the best way to lay down some serious miles...on a trail. For off trail I'll often go with boots, if only because they prevent my ankles from getting constantly scraped.


# ========

# [33] Anniversary Sale runs May 18 to 28th and the next national Used Gear Sale is June 9th.

# ========

# [34] I agree those boots are great.
# Light enough and with a good pair of socks your feet do ok after a long day if hiking.

# ========

# [35] I agree. I love my Lowa, and the Renegade actually comes in a good size wide, if that’s an issue for you.

# ========

# [36] > and always measure them because the customer is never right

# You're almost entirely right, but shoe sizes are never right either.  I sold a shit load of boots an never once measured.  Start from how it fits and go from there, it saves time.  A 9 here might be a 10 there or whatever. 
#  Most important is that you have don't feel a good bit of slippage on the heal when stepping up (with weight - either hold yourself back to imitate it or put on a pack with sand bags) and that stamping on your way forward doesn't cause pressure points.  This will largely depend on how the show is shaped, which you just have to see how it fits - although there are trends such as keen running wide and Solomon running narrow, but it's more complicated than that.  You can make slight adjustments with socks and the way you lace it.  Always test it.  Without testing it you're making a $250+ gamble.

# Also, the whole don't go waterproof is a fad and it's coming out of areas and types of hikers that may not apply.  Never go with a "don't do this" go with a "don't do this if you want x,y,z."  Shoe design is always a compromise and there is no single solution.  Only solutions that fit needs. 

# ========

# [37] Im on my third set of moab 2 mid gore-tex. I wear them 5 days a week working landscaping, and take them hiking on the weekends. Love em. Light weight, good tread for working hillsides, good ankle support, gore tex keeps me dry while adjusting sprinklers, never get sweaty, At 150 they're good price and I have found them for about 110. They last about 8 months. I'll likely buy em again. 

# ========

# [38] Third. The only downside I see is that they aren't crampon compatible. I haven't tried them on really nasty skree yet either to test durability of the uppers.

# ========

# [39] I think it's pretty hard to go wrong with solomons. My buddy loved his 4d gtx but scree ate the toe pretty bad within a year or so (to be fair he was doing 14ers like mad that year). I went slightly cheaper with the x ultra mid gtx and haven't had an issue at all.

# ========

# [40] Agreed. I like to buy waterproof because spring is super slushy in my region but to warm for my snow boots.

# ========

# [41] Thank you! I knew about the anniversary sale but wasn’t totally sure on garage 

# ========

# [42] I have used them with strap on crampons for general mountaineering and they were pretty solid. 

# ========

# [43] Concur. I have a pair and the Sheriff of Baghdad recommends them as well. Can’t go wrong. 

# ========

# [44] They're pretty solid on nasty scree, there's nicks and dings in the leather but nothing remotely deep. I'm a Geologist and that's pretty standard fieldwork terrain for us.
